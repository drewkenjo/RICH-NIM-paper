\section{Results}

We saw that although there is little difference in crosstalk signals, the H12700 PMTs suffer less from dark current, have narrower SPE spectra, and have higher $\mu$ and relative efficiency values.
%An example plot of the $\mu$'s and relative efficiencies of H8500 and H12700 PMTs with similar low and high gains is shown in Figure \ref{efficiency}.


We see that the relative efficiency is closely related to the $\mu$ which is on average, over all pixels at all voltages for all the PMTs we tested, $29\pm5$ percent higher in H12700 than H8500 MAPMTs. One concern with these $\mu$ measurements however is that the laser system used to measure these PMTs was only incident on a portion of each pixel, consequently missing their sum total effect and pinpointing possible spatial dependencies which should be further studied and perhaps remeasured with a fully illuminated MAPMT instead of collimated pinpoint laser light. In terms of crosstalk for the two varieties of MAPMT the H12700s appear to be better than the H8500s. The H12700s have a decrease in crosstalk by nearly a factor of two. Additional studies of dark current in the H12700s would be useful, as the dark current is usually dominated by individual pixels or bad regions of the PMT instead of spread around evenly like in the H8500s, but overall the two varieties are not very different in terms of dark current.
