Fig  10+11:  It  is  difficult  to  clearly  observe  the  various  features  in  the  plots.   Additionally,  there  is no indication in the Figure caption which side of the dashed red line is being cut.  The central figure should have units on the y-axis (counts or arb.  units).  The central figure should probably have the same x-axis range as the other figures in the panel.  Similarly for Fig 11.
\end{tcolorbox}

The resolutions of Fig 10+11 were improved, a label was added to the central figures of both, and the axes ranges were made consistent throughout. Additionally, more text was added to the captions for both figures to address which side of the dashed red line is cut and to clarify the signature of the crosstalk in the neighboring pixels.

The paper is written as a long experimental note and is characterized by a pronounced verbosity. As a general comment the paper is quite difficult to read.
\end{tcolorbox}

We believe that being the experimental note, the paper presents the state of the art work in the experimental approach to the process of selection and calibration of photomultipliers for use in the large scale Cherenkov detectors. 

Apart from being an experimental note, this work introduces the new extension of the calculational model describing the PMT response to few-photoelectron events, which takes into account the description and characterization of the effect of the signal cross-talk in Multianode PMTs.
The new method of selection between the true events and the events when a signal is caused by the hit in a neighboring pixel will help improve the spatial resolution of single photoelectron detectors.

We think we made every effort to explain and justify all our measurements and analysis to the level that can be used by other experimentalists.

In an attempt to make the paper easier to read we have added at the end of the Introduction the brief descriptions of the Sections' content.

A list of specifications and requirements on the PMTs coming from the CLAS12 RICH are not clearly defined at the beginning of the paper, therefore the reader must guess which are the most important parameters to be measured and what characteristics will define a "good" PMT for the CLAS12 RICH production

The type of MaPMTs studied in this paper (Hamamatsu H12700) have been characterized and described in the literature and are characterized by a large pixel-by-pixel and tube-by-tube gain variation (with a typical spread of 1 to 3). In addition, this type of MaPMT has some typical features of the individual pixel response which depend on the pixel position inside the matrix. Indication of the "pixel number" appears in the text and in specific plots (starting from section 4), and a channel map with channel numbers should be introduced to let the reader fully understand the measurements

I agree with the statement. The PMT channel map information might be there already, just need to highlight or give it more stress/explanation in the text.

Pixel-by-pixel and tube-by-tube gain variation and the individual pixel response 
depending on the pixel position inside the matrix is the goal of the study presented in the paper.

This MaPMT type is also affected by after-pulses, which might have a strong impact for the CLAS12 RICH operations and not mentioned at all in the paper

{\bfseries Pavel}
Need to find a reference mentioning after-pulses and explain that such study was not considered important because the RICH signals are not in trigger and the delayed pulses do not interfere with our data. They may increase the accidental noise which is measured separately in the detector. By the way, I guess it can be observed in RICH-1 by plotting rates vs. time agter the beam stop? 

"Characterization of the Hamamatsu H12700A-03 and R12699-03 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes"


https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04302.pdf

Although our setup (based on single photons emitted at random by a DC-biased LED) is not able to quantify the afterpulse probability for the present device, it is expected to be below 5\% for a PMT with a good quality vacuum, as explained in [7].

{\bfseries note to editor:}

- no immediate afterpulses (include scope picture)

- delayed afterpulses are not important to us

{\bfseries Pavel}
Maybe include in the beginning somewhere: "During our tests we have not  seen any effects of the immediate after-pulses observed by other authors (see, for example, Ref.~[]). No oscilloscope traces, no instabilities in the amplitude spectra showed their presence. The long-delayed after-pulses are not critical for the RICH in which only time-synchronized events are accepted."

All the main results of the paper refer to a computational model, described in detail in Ref. [12], which is adapted to the experimental conditions described in the paper (in section 6 and in the appendix). This is the part of the paper which is the most difficult to read and understand. Multiple citations of Ref. [12] are made in the text, and the reader is forced to go to that reference to fully understand in detail the procedure described in the paper.

{\bfseries Pavel}
That is a correct statement. The computational model describes the amplitude distributions of signals coming from every PMT pixel in the conditions of low light and allows to extract its important physical parameters. Such as its amplification gain in pC per one photoelectron, the average multiplicity of the observed photoelectrons in given conditions (which can be converted to quantum efficiency), approximate shape of the single-photoelectron spectrum. All this can be done independently of the test conditions. The new extension of the model allows to evaluate the cross-talk effects between neighboring pixels and evaluate the optimal amplitude to separate between them. As it is now, the model is quite complicated, and to fully understand the outcome the familiarity with Ref. [12] is required. 

{\bfseries note to editor:}

- it is a complicated subject
- impossible to reply because there is no question

The fit parameter results show some inconsistencies in Fig. 14-15-16 (especially the mu parameter in the top-right plot in each figure).
\end{tcolorbox}


Fig. 14 is not consistent with 15 and 16 because it is done with different MaPMT.
And for Fig. 15 and 16, there is actually a good consistency.
The High Voltages are different which affects the gain of the MaPMT, therefore the major change is in the "scale" parameter, while $\mu$ (light intensity) stays the same.
The statistical spread of other parameters is expected.

The differences between the plots (a)-(d) in the Figs. 14-15-16 are discussed in the captions and in the text.
Parameter $\mu$ (light intensity) depends on the type of data (3mm or 6mm mask, open pixel with software crosstalk removal, and model approximation).
In case of H8500 (Fig. 14) the model cannot extract the crosstalk correctly because it's too wide and merges with the signal stronger.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enlarge top by=2em,colbacktitle=black!60!white,colframe=black!80!white,left=0pt,right=0pt,top=0pt,bottom=0pt,boxrule=0.3pt,title=\bfseries2.08]
The chi2 of the 4 fits presented in Fig. 18 is very high, which indicates that probably the model does not represent the data well for the "highest light intensity" configuration. The illumination conditions are described in different ways that confuse the reader: a precise and unique definition should be used throughout the text

The computational model returns a set of parameters after the fit which should be related to the "physical observables" typical of a PMT, like e.g. quantum efficiency (QE) or gain. Most of the "measurements" presented in the paper are the result of a fit using the above-mentioned model, and are not compared with independent measurements, which would be necessary to assess the correctness of the model. Only self-consistency checks of the model are partially shown in the paper. Just to quote a few examples:

{\bfseries Pavel}
That is a tough one. Develop another model and measure the same parameters to compare… Not clear what would constitute an “independent measurement”. Should we stress again that every pixel was evaluated in six independent measurements with consistent results. Plus the systematic error studies.

{\bfseries note to editor:}

- statistical errors are there (very small)

- explain in details that the reviewer misunderstands the plots

- no independent measurements can reasonably be performed

- mention "quasi model independent" extraction of mu/gain for 1spe spectra and their comparison with Pavel's model

The top-right plot in Fig. 19 shows QE measurements as a function of the anode number for a PMT. No error bars (except probably the ones on the fit parameters) are indicated to understand the precision in the estimate of this important quantity (no evaluation of systematic errors). A comparison with an independent measurement would be important, even on a limited number of MaPMTs (e.g. measurement of the absolute QE made using a calibrated monocromatic light source)

The top-left plot in Fig. 19 shows the scale (proportional to the PMT anode gain) as a function of the anode number for a PMT. Some variation is shown, still without error bars (or with error bars only coming from the fit parameters, with no systematic error evaluation).

In conclusion, the paper presents measurements on a large PMT population (about 400 detectors), which are essentially based on a computational model described in another paper (Ref. [12]).

{\bfseries As stated in reply to 2.01:}

We believe that being the experimental note, the paper presents the state of the art work in the experimental approach to the process of selection and calibration of photomultipliers for use in the large scale Cherenkov detectors. 

Apart from being an experimental note, this work introduces the new extension of the calculational model describing the PMT response to few-photoelectron events, which takes into account the description and characterization of the effect of the signal cross-talk in Multianode PMTs.

In its current form the paper does not satisfy the Journal requirements and should not be published. A major revision is needed, strongly reducing the written text to improve conciseness and reducing the number of plots, inserting only representative ones. What is missing in particular is the list of specifications on the PMTs coming from the physics of the experiment, and the requirements that the PMTs must satisfy to pass the "selection" to be mounted inside the second RICH of CLAS12, as the reader might expect reading the title.
\end{tcolorbox}

We respectfully disagree with the request to strongly reduce the written text and number of plots.
We believe such change would make the work less comprehensible.
The list of the PMT specifications and requirements has been added to the introduction as stated in the reply to 2.02.

In addition, the validation of the model using independent data on individual parameters is needed to assess the precision of the used method (just to quote an example, a comparison of QE with independently measured values, e.g. by Hamamatsu or by a calibrated monocromatic light source), which lacks evaluation of systematic uncertainties on the presented parameters.
\end{tcolorbox}


The comparison of the QE with Hamamatsu data is given in the paper.
Addressing the comments from reviewers helped to improve the clarity of the paper.
Unfortunately the precise comparison of the anode gains with Hamamatsu data is not possible since they are using different techniques and report values convoluted with quantum efficiencies with unknown scale of light intensities.
But qualitatively the agreement is good.
