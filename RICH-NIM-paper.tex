\begin{abstract}
We present results of the detailed study of several hundred Multianode Photomiltiplier Tubes (MAPMT) H12700 from Hamamatsu, characterizing their response to the Cherenkov light photons in the second Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector, a part in the CLAS12 upgrade at Jefferson Lab.
Using the same dedicated front-end electronics as in the main RICH detector, the laser test setup allowed us to extract the single photoelectron responses of every pixel in the MAPMT set,
characterize its properties such as gain, quantum efficiency, signal crosstalk between neighboring pixels,
and determine the optimal signal threshold values to evaluate its efficiency to Cherenkov photons.
The total number of pixels studied was 25,536. The recently published state-of-the-art computational model, describing photon detector response functions measured in the conditions of low light, was extended to include the successful description of the crosstalk contributions to the spectra.
The database of extracted parameters will be used for the final selection and arrangement of the MAPMTs in the new RICH detector, and determine their optimal operation parameters.
The results show that the quality of H12700 MAPMTs is high, satisfying our needs in the good position-sensitive single photoelectron detectors.
