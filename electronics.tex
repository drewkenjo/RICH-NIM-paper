The measurements of custom front-end electronics together with the installed MaPMTs in the RICH black box setup were crucial to understand their performance in the RICH detector.
To test and calibrate it, multiple tests with an internal onboard charge injector, an external charge injector, and a signal generator were performed.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:MAPMTtest}, the RICH MaPMT test setup can house two FE boards inside the black box.
The communication between the FPGA board and the PC is performed using TCP/IP protocol over optical Ethernet (1000BASE-SX).
The data acquisition program executes on a remote PC running Linux OS, configures the FPGA and MAROC boards, and collects the data through a network interface.
The current setup allows fast evaluation of the FE modules with a highly automated procedure, which is important because the RICH panel consists of 115 tiles with 3-MaPMT and 23 tiles with 2-MaPMT FE modules.
